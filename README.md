## :sparkles: [Welcome to Shelter in Space!](https://shelter-in-space.netlify.app/) :sparkles:

With your body, you can visit the world. With your mind (and some help from the Internet) you can visit the universe. 

This minimal website was created for anyone feeling cooped up during the current shelter-in-place. It leverages React hooks, CSS, and the axios HTTP client to fetch and display images and videos of the cosmos from [NASA's Photo of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod). 

### Scripts, in case you'd like to play around with this

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
`npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
